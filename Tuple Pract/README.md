<h1>Another Sorter but this time with Tuples :3 </h1>

Very simple project that sorts through the emails in a file and finds the time sent. It creates a list then a dictonary for a historgram count of these.

this was the first program i made <b>entirely</b> by myself without looking anything up. Well the lamda function syntax i had to refresh my mind about but it was just the `x: x[0]` portion

<h3>Example of the output</h3>
