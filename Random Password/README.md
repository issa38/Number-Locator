<h1>Simple password generator that uses ASCII and random elements.</h1>

Its a little more secure than just a random amount of code but its nothing that complicated. I want to in the future have it so that the random passwords are associated with the website they are apart. but that's for a future me and I have no idea how to do it now.

Sample of what the output looks like:
<br>
Your password is: IqpprFdz6A
Your password is: UO5LCdsAry
