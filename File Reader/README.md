<h1> Simple File Reader that reads the sample file</h1>

The program takes in the file and reads it to find the Average Spam confidence level of each individual email.

This what just a test for me to understand file reading and how a python works with it.

I think this might do well in the future if I incorporate a way to decode and encode certain things with this like password hashing and the such.
