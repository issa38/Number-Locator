Simple Python script that takes in user input and finds the number in the generated list.

It's nothing special but its my first Python script and I just wanted to test the waters. I've been really focusing on preparing the code to handle errors and such as good programs shouldn't be obliterated if something is input wrong.

Anyway, this was a fun project.
